# PORTFOLIO-PROJECT
# Charlotte Lai — Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio!  
This website showcases my projects, skills, and the journey I'm taking as an aspiring Front-End Developer & Designer.

I built this portfolio as part of the _nology training program, using the tools and conventions I’ve learned so far — including SCSS, BEM naming conventions, responsive layout techniques, and clean semantic HTML.
